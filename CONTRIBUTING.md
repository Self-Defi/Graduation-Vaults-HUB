# Contributing

## What This Repo Is
This is the GraduationVaults.com Hub: documentation, onboarding assets, and front-end pages that explain the system.

**Non-negotiable rule:** SD Advisory Group never holds keys, never signs transactions, and never touches donated funds.

## Ways to Contribute
- Fix typos and improve clarity (especially role-based explanations)
- Improve UX/accessibility (mobile-first)
- Add diagrams and architecture visuals
- Harden security language to reduce user error
- Improve README / docs structure

## How to Propose Changes
1. Open an Issue describing the change and the reason (keep it specific).
2. Submit a Pull Request referencing the issue.

## Pull Request Standards
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Match Self-Defi tone: clear, direct, no hype.
- No “yield promises” or investment language.
- No custodial workflows suggested.
- Ensure all links are correct and non-deceptive.

## Styling / Brand Notes
- Palette: Navy + Cream + Gold (Self-Defi)
- Prefer plain HTML/CSS (minimal JS)
- Mobile layout must remain readable and clean

## Security / Safety
If your contribution touches security or user safety (wallet flows, links, scripts),
explain the risk and mitigation in the PR description.

## License
By contributing, you agree your contributions are licensed under the repository license (MIT).
